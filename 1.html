    <h2>Cannoli</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannoli" target="_blank" title="wikipedia - cannoli">Cannoli</a> are Sicilian pastries consisting of a tube-shaped shell of <strong>fried <u>pastry</u> dough</strong>, filled with a sweet, creamy filling containing ricotta cheese. Their size ranges from 9 to 20 centimetres (3+1/2 to 8 in). In mainland Italy, the food is commonly known as cannolo siciliano (lit. 'Sicilian cannoli').

    </p><p>In culinary traditions across Sicily, regional variations in cannoli fillings reflect local preferences and ingredient availability. In Palermo, cannoli are decorated with candied orange zest, adding a citrusy sweetness to the filling. In Catania, chopped pistachios are favored, adding a distinctive nutty flavor and texture. Ramacca is known for its purple artichokes, which also feature as filling in some cannoli recipes.</p>
