    <h2>Italian Desserts</h2>
    <p>Italy has an extremely diverse range of cuisines, due to the many culinary influences throughout its history. Peaches, lemons, and pears are popular fruits for recipes, as well as sweet cheeses, such as ricotta and mascarpone. Coffee, especially espresso, are integral to Italian culture and cuisine, and is featured frequently in dessert recipes, such as tiramis√π. Cold dairy desserts, such as ice cream and gelato, were introduced to the Western world through Italy.
